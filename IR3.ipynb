    "Purpose of the Practical\n",
    "The purpose is to build a probabilistic model that represents \"cause and effect\" (or more accurately, \"dependency\") between different variables.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike other models that just find a final answer, a Bayesian Network lets you ask \"what if?\" questions and see how probabilities change.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you're not just predicting if a patient has heart disease. You are building a model to answer questions like:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"What is the probability this patient has heart disease, given that their age is 38?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "\"If we find out their cholesterol is 212, how does that change the probability?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a powerful way to model uncertainty and reasoning, just like how a doctor thinks.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Core Theory (How it Works)\n",
    "A Bayesian Network (also called a Bayes Net) has two parts:\n",
    "\n",
    "The Structure (The Graph): A Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) where each node is a variable (like 'age', 'sex', 'heartdisease'). The arrows (edges) show the dependencies.\n",
    "\n",
    "The arrow (age, trestbps) means \"Age has a direct influence on Resting Blood Pressure (trestbps).\"\n",
    "\n",
    "'Age' is the parent and 'trestbps' is the child.\n",
    "\n",
    "This structure is defined by you (the programmer) based on domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Probabilities (The CPTs): Each node has a Conditional Probability Table (CPT).\n",
    "\n",
    "Root nodes (with no parents, like 'age') have a simple probability (e.g., P(age)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Child nodes (with parents, like 'heartdisease') have a conditional probability (e.g., P(heartdisease | age, fbs)). This table stores the probability of heart disease for every possible combination of its parents.\n",
    "\n",
    "The program's \"learning\" (model.fit) part is just its process of calculating all these CPTs from your dataset. \"Inference\" (HeartDisease_infer.query) is the process of using these tables and Bayes' theorem to calculate the final probability you asked for.\n",
    "\n",
    "📋 Step-by-Step Code Explanation\n",
    "Import Libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "pandas: To load and clean the heart.csv data.\n",
    "\n",
    "BayesianModel: The main class from pgmpy to create the structure of your network.\n",
    "\n",
    "MaximumLikelihoodEstimator: This is the \"learning\" algorithm. It will look at your data and calculate all the CPTs.\n",
    "\n",
    "VariableElimination: This is the \"inference\" algorithm. It's the tool you use to ask questions (.query()).\n",
    "\n",
    "Load Data: The code loads heart.csv into a pandas DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define Model Structure:\n",
    "\n",
    "model = BayesianModel([...]): This is where you define the graph structure.\n",
    "\n",
    "The list of tuples, like ('age', 'trestbps') and ('fbs', 'heartdisease'), tells pgmpy which arrows to draw between which nodes. This is the \"expert knowledge\" part of the practical.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the Model (Learning):\n",
    "\n",
    "model.fit(heartDisease, ...): This line \"trains\" the model. It uses the MaximumLikelihoodEstimator to go through the heartDisease DataFrame and calculate all the CPTs based on the structure you defined.\n",
    "\n",
    "Create Inference Engine:\n",
    "\n",
    "HeartDisease_infer = VariableElimination(model): This line prepares the model to answer questions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perform Inference (Querying):\n",
    "\n",
    "HeartDisease_infer.query(variables=['heartdisease'], evidence={'age': 38}): This is the key part. You are asking the model:\n",
    "\n",
    "variables=['heartdisease']: \"What is the probability of 'heartdisease'...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "evidence={'age': 38}: \"...given the evidence that the 'age' is 38?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The code then does the same thing for evidence={'chol': 212}.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output is the probability table showing the final answer (e.g., 28.59% chance of heart disease for age=38).\n",
