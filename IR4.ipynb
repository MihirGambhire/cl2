    "Purpose of the Practical\n",
    "The purpose is to build a supervised machine learning model that can automatically read an email and classify it as either \"Spam\" (junk) or \"Ham\" (a normal, non-junk email).\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a classic \"Text Classification\" problem. We will train a model on a dataset of emails that are already labeled as 'spam' or 'ham'. The model will learn the patterns of words associated with spam, and then we'll use it to predict the label for new, unseen emails.\n",
    "\n",
    "🧠 Core Theory (How it Works)\n",
    "This practical involves two key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "TF-IDF Vectorization: Computers don't understand words, they only understand numbers. We need to convert the text of each email into a numerical format. We do this using TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Term Frequency (TF): How often a word appears in one email. A word like \"win\" appearing 5 times is important.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inverse Document Frequency (IDF): How \"rare\" a word is across all emails. A common word like \"the\" (low IDF) is ignored. A rare word like \"lottery\" or \"viagra\" (high IDF) is a very strong signal.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Score: The TF-IDF score is high for words that are frequent in one email but rare overall. This helps the model identify important, signal-carrying words.\n",
    "\n",
    "Multinomial Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB): This is the classification algorithm (the \"brain\") we are using.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's a fast, simple, and highly effective algorithm for text.\n",
    "\n",
    "It uses Bayes' Theorem to calculate the probability of an email being \"Spam\" given the set of TF-IDF scores for the words it contains.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's called \"Naive\" because it naively assumes that every word is independent of the others (e.g., it doesn't care that \"free\" and \"prize\" appear together, just that both words are present).\n",
    "\n",
    "📋 Step-by-Step Code Explanation\n",
    "Import Libraries: We import pandas to read the CSV, train_test_split to divide our data, TfidfVectorizer to convert text to numbers, MultinomialNB as our classifier, and accuracy_score to check our work.\n",
    "\n",
    "Load & Clean Data:\n",
    "\n",
    "We use pd.read_csv('spam.csv') to load the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important cleaning step is clean_data['category_num'] = .... This converts the text labels \"ham\" and \"spam\" into the numbers 0 and 1, which the model can understand.\n",
    "\n",
    "Define X and y: We set our X (features) to be the message column (the text) and our y (target) to be the category_num column (the 0 or 1 label).\n",
    "\n",
    "Split Data: We use train_test_split to split our data.\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train & y_train: The training set (e.g., 70% of the data). The model learns from this.\n",
    "\n",
    "X_test & y_test: The testing set (e.g., 30% of the data). We \"hide\" this from the model to check its performance later.\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Extraction (TF-IDF): This is the most crucial part.\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a TfidfVectorizer object.\n",
    "\n",
    "X_train_features = feature_extraction.fit_transform(X_train): This does two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "fit: It reads all of X_train to learn the entire vocabulary (all unique words).\n",
    "\n",
    "transform: It converts the text in X_train into a matrix of TF-IDF numbers.\n",
    "\n",
    "X_test_features = feature_extraction.transform(X_test): It uses the same vocabulary learned from X_train to convert X_test into a number matrix.\n",
    "\n",
    "Train the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "We create a MultinomialNB object.\n",
    "\n",
    "model.fit(X_train_features, y_train): This is the \"training.\" The model learns the probability patterns that connect the TF-IDF numbers (the words) to their correct labels (spam or ham).\n",
    "\n",
    "Evaluate the Model:\n",
    "\n",
    "prediction_on_test_data = model.predict(X_test_features): We use the trained model to make predictions on the \"hidden\" test data.\n",
    "\n",
    "accuracy_score(y_test, prediction_on_test_data): We compare the model's predictions to the actual answers (y_test) to calculate its accuracy.\n",
